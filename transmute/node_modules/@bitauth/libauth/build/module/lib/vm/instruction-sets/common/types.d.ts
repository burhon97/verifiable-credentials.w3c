/**
 * This method attempts to parse a "Script Number", a format with which numeric
 * values are represented on the stack. (The Satoshi implementation calls this
 * `CScriptNum`.)
 *
 * If `bytes` is a valid Script Number, this method returns the represented
 * number in BigInt format. If `bytes` is not valid, a `ScriptNumberError` is
 * returned.
 *
 * All common operations accepting numeric parameters or pushing numeric values
 * to the stack currently use the Script Number format. The binary format of
 * numbers wouldn't be important if they could only be operated on by arithmetic
 * operators, but since the results of these operations may become input to
 * other operations (e.g. hashing), the specific representation is consensus-
 * critical.
 *
 * Parsing of Script Numbers is limited to 4 bytes (with the exception of
 * OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, which read up to 5-bytes).
 * The bytes are read as a signed integer (for 32-bits: inclusive range from
 * -2^31 + 1 to 2^31 - 1) in little-endian byte order. Script Numbers must
 * further be encoded as minimally as possible (no zero-padding). See code/tests
 * for details.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Operators may push numeric results to the stack which exceed the current
 * 4-byte length limit of Script Numbers. While these stack elements would
 * otherwise be valid Script Numbers, because of the 4-byte length limit, they
 * can only be used as non-numeric values in later operations.
 *
 * Most other implementations currently parse Script Numbers into 64-bit
 * integers to operate on them (rather than integers of arbitrary size like
 * BigInt). Currently, no operators are at risk of overflowing 64-bit integers
 * given 32-bit integer inputs, but future operators may require additional
 * refactoring in those implementations.
 *
 * @param bytes - a Uint8Array from the stack
 * @param requireMinimalEncoding - if true, this method returns an error when
 * parsing non-minimally encoded Script Numbers
