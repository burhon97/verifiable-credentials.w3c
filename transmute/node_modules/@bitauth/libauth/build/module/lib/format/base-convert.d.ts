/**
 * Create a `BaseConverter`, which exposes methods for encoding and decoding
 * `Uint8Array`s using bitcoin-style padding: each leading zero in the input is
 * replaced with the zero-index character of the `alphabet`, then the remainder
 * of the input is encoded as a large number in the specified alphabet.
 *
 * For example, using the alphabet `01`, the input `[0, 15]` is encoded `01111`
 * â€“ a single `0` represents the leading padding, followed by the base2 encoded
 * `0x1111` (15). With the same alphabet, the input `[0, 0, 255]` is encoded
 * `0011111111` - only two `0` characters are required to represent both
 * leading zeros, followed by the base2 encoded `0x11111111` (255).
 *
 * **This is not compatible with `RFC 3548`'s `Base16`, `Base32`, or `Base64`.**
 *
 * If the alphabet is malformed, this method returns the error as a `string`.
 *
 * @param alphabet - an ordered string which maps each index to a character,
 * e.g. `0123456789`.
 * @privateRemarks
 * Algorithm from the `base-x` implementation (which is derived from the
 * original Satoshi implementation): https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/base-x
