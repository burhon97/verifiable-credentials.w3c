 * - The less common `mainnet-uncompressed` and `testnet-uncompressed` values
 * indicate that the address should use the uncompressed form of the public key
 * (65 bytes beginning with `0x04`) on the specified network.

 *
 * To indicate that the private key is intended for use in a P2PKH address using

 * payload prior to encoding. For the uncompressed construction, the extra byte
 * is omitted.
